https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-science-in-a-nutshell-evidence-of-a-warming-planet-2?__hub_id=100,"This video is part of the Climate Science in a Nutshell series. This short, animated video looks at evidence of a rapidly warming planet. It discusses how air bubbles in ice cores can be used to estimate Earth's average air temperature for thousands of years and how direct measurements document air temperatures from 1880.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Physical Geography,Archaeology
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-science-in-a-nutshell-where-does-carbon-dioxide-come-from-2?__hub_id=100,"This short video discusses where carbon dioxide, the gas that is mainly responsible for warming up our planet and changing the climate, comes from. It discusses how the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide comes directly from the burning of fossil fuels and indirectly from the human need for energy.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-science-in-a-nutshell-you-can-make-a-difference-2?__hub_id=100,"This short video makes the case that rapid climate change affects the whole planet, but individuals can make a difference and make their carbon footprint smaller. Common suggestions are identified for young children to consciously consider what they can do.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-simulator?__hub_id=100,"This is a simulation that illustrates how temperature will be affected by global CO2 emission trajectories. It addresses the issue that even if global emissions begin to decrease, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 will continue to increase, resulting in increased global temperatures.","History, Law, Politics",Physical Science,Geoscience
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-time-machine-3?__hub_id=100,"This series of four animations shows how some of the key indicators of climate change (average global temperature, sea level, sea ice extent, carbon emissions) have changed in Earth's recent history.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-variability-in-the-equatorial-pacific-2?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students work with climate data from the tropical Pacific Ocean to understand how sea-surface temperature and atmospheric pressure affect precipitation in the tropical Pacific in a case study format.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-variability-in-the-north-atlantic-2?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students examine climate variability in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NOA) in a case study format.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-wisconsin-adaptation-mitigation-2?__hub_id=100,"This short, animated video describes what is meant by climate, its characteristics, and the range of impacts due to climate change.   The difference between mitigation and adaptation is also discussed.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-wisconsin-extreme-heat-3?__hub_id=100,"This short video addresses the effects of heat waves on human populations, with Black residents of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the visual subjects. The narrative is done by a young spoken- word artist.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-wisconsin-ice-cover-3?__hub_id=100,This is an interactive graph that involves records of ice cover in two Wisconsin lakes - Lake Mendota and Lake Monona - from 1855-2010.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-wisconsin-stories-from-a-state-of-change?__hub_id=100,This video provides background information and teaching tips about the history and relevance of phenology and seasonal observations of plants and animals within the context of rural Wisconsin.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Biology,Ecology,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-wizard-2?__hub_id=100,This is an interactive webtool that allows the user to choose a state or country and both assess how climate has changed over time and project what future changes are predicted to occur in a given area.,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-and-weather?__hub_id=100,"This video discusses the differences between climate and weather by defining and presenting examples of each. When presenting examples of weather, the video focuses on severe events and how meteorologists predict and study the weather using measurement, satellites, and radar. The climate focus is primarily on an overview of climate zones.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/climate-change-how-do-we-know-2?__hub_id=100,"This static graph of changes in CO2 concentrations goes back 400,000 years, showing the dramatic spike in recent years.",Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/clouds-protocol?__hub_id=100,"Students observe which types of clouds are visible, how much of the sky is covered by clouds, and the opacity of clouds. They also report on surface and sky conditions, to complement views from satellites.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
