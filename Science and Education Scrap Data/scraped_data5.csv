https://oercommons.org/courses/biofuels-biomass-cellulose-lab-2?__hub_id=100,"In this lab activity, students investigate how to prepare a biofuel source for conversion to a combustible product.  The activity models how raw materials are refined to process liquid fuels.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/biofuels-video-4?__hub_id=100,This video provides an overview of the research of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on converting biomass to liquid fuels.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/biomass-creating-bio-diesel?__hub_id=100,This detailed chemistry lesson from the U.S. Department of Energy focuses on transforming vegetable oil into biodiesel through a process of transesterification. The process described offers a good model for many chemical reaction processes that are used to produce a viable product.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/biomass-investigating-gases?__hub_id=100,In this lab activity students generate their own biomass gases by heating wood pellets or wood splints in a test tube. They collect the resulting gases and use the gas to roast a marshmallow. Students also evaluate which biomass fuel is the best by their own criteria or by examining the volume of gas produced by each type of fuel.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/bioprospecting-for-cellulose-degrading-microbes-individual-isolate-method-2?__hub_id=100,"This is a long-term inquiry activity in which students investigate locations they believe harbor cellulose-digesting microbes, collect samples, isolate them on selective media, and screen them for cellulase activity. These novel microbes may be useful for the production of cellulosic ethanol. In the process they learn about plating techniques, serial dilutions, symbiotic relationships and enzyme specificity. Two methods are provided, one focusing on isolation of pure microbial strains, the other focusing on finding symbiotic communities of microbes. The companion activity is here: https://www.glbrc.org/outreach/educational-materials/bioprospecting-cellulose-degrading-microbes-filter-paper-assay",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/bird-s-eye-view-lesson-plan?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students construct &amp;quot;flying birds&amp;quot; (pollution collectors) from paper and wire hangers. Students hang up their birds to see how they react to air pollution, and compare and make observations about the differences in the birds.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/birds-mosquitoes-and-viruses-3?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students distinguish between directly and indirectly transmitted diseases and participate in a group game to simulate the spread of vector-borne diseases. They then research a particular pathogenic disease to learn how global warming and biodiversity loss can affect disease transmission.",Physical Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/black-carbon?__hub_id=100,"This video describes what black carbon is, where is comes from, and how it contributes to sea ice melt and global warming.",Atmospheric Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/black-ice-a-slippery-arctic-road-3?__hub_id=100,"In this series of activities students investigate the effects of black carbon on snow and ice melt in the Arctic. The lesson begins with an activity that introduces students to the concept of thermal energy and how light and dark surfaces reflect and absorb radiant energy differently. To help quantify the relationship between carbon and ice melt, the wet lab activity has students create ice samples both with and without black carbon and then compare how they respond to radiant energy while considering implications for the Arctic.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-blob-the-story-of-the-pacific-heatwave?__hub_id=100,"This video explores the affect on seabirds of a three year ocean warming event (2013-16) in the NW Pacific. With ocean warming, a massive die off occurred based on the decline of food resources.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/blooming-thermometers?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students develop an understanding of the relationship between natural phenomena, weather, and climate change: the study known as phenology. In addition, they learn how cultural events are tied to the timing of seasonal events. Students brainstorm annual natural phenomena that are tied to seasonal weather changes. Next, they receive information regarding the Japanese springtime festival of Hanami, celebrating the appearance of cherry blossoms. Students plot and interpret average bloom date data from over the past 1100 years.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-buffer-zone-acid-base-chemistry-in-the-world-2?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students conduct a short hands-on demonstration that simulates ocean acidification resulting from excess atmospheric carbon dioxide and discuss potential implications of increases in ocean temperatures and acidification due to climate change.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/byrd-polar-research-center-climate-model-simulation?__hub_id=100,"This set of animations and interactive simulations from the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University helps students develop an understanding of models used to understand the Earth system. Students consider the types of data that need to be included in a climate model, looking at inputs, outputs, and variables. The animations show how data is calculated for grid cells and assembled into a comprehensive model.",Physical Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/co2-in-the-ice-core-record-4?__hub_id=100,"This video segment, from the 'Earth: The Operators' Manual' featuring climate expert Richard Alley, shows how ice cores stored at the National Ice Core Lab provide evidence that ancient ice contains records of Earth's past climate - specifically carbon dioxide and temperature.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/co2-the-atmosphere-2?__hub_id=100,"This video is narrated by climate scientist Richard Alley. It examines studies US Air Force conducted over 50 years ago on the warming effects of CO2 in the atmosphere and how that could impact missile warfare. The video then focuses on the Franz Josef glacier in New Zealand; the glacier is used to demonstrate a glacier's formation, depth of snow fall in the past, and understand atmospheric gases and composition during the last Ice Age. Supplemental resources are available through the website.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
https://oercommons.org/courses/c-roads-world-climate-simulator-2?__hub_id=100,"C-ROADS is a simplified version of a climate simulator. Its primary purpose is to help users understand the long-term climate effects (CO2 concentrations, global temperature, sea level rise) of various customized actions to reduce fossil fuel CO2 emissions, reduce deforestation, and grow more trees. Students can ask multiple, customized what-if questions and understand why the system reacts as it does.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies
