The video examines the idea of pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere via a passive chemical process.",Physical Science,,,,
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-calculator-activity-2?__hub_id=100,"In this learning activity, students use a web-based carbon calculator to determine their carbon footprint on the basis of their personal and household habits and choices. Students identify which personal activities and household choices produce the most CO2 emissions, compare their carbon footprint to the U.S. and global averages, and identify lifestyle changes they can make to reduce their footprint.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,,

Players will need to bring together governments, industries, and the public to bring carbon levels to zero before it's too late.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,,
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-carbon-crisis-in-90-seconds-2?__hub_id=100,This video features a short animated sequence that illustrates the difference between young and old carbon released into the atmosphere from the consumption of food (young carbon) and the burning of fossil fuels (old carbon).,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-cycle-11?__hub_id=100,"This activity from NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory introduces students to the scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect and the carbon cycle. The activity leads them through several interactive tasks to investigate recent trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Students analyze scientific data and use scientific reasoning to determine the causes responsible for these recent trends. By studying carbon cycle science in a visual and interactive manner, students can learn firsthand about the reasons behind our changing climate.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-cycle-10?__hub_id=100,This interactive animation focuses on the carbon cycle and includes embedded videos and captioned images to provide greater clarification and detail of the cycle than would be available by a single static visual alone.,Environmental Studies,Biology,Physical Science,Chemistry,Geology
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-carbon-cycle-game-2?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students develop concept maps of the carbon cycle through a die-rolling game that simulates carbon reservoirs and fluxes. By the end of this activity, students should be able to describe and explain how the carbon cycle has changed in the last 250 years.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Biology,Physical Science,Chemistry

https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-dioxide-exercise-2?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students work in groups, plotting carbon dioxide concentrations over time on overheads and estimating the rate of change over five years. Stacked together, the overheads for the whole class show an increase on carbon dioxide over five years and annual variation driven by photosynthesis. This exercise enables students to practice basic quantitative skills and understand how important sampling intervals can be when studying changes over time. A goal is to see how small sample size may give incomplete picture of data.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science,
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-dioxide-removal-2?__hub_id=100,"In this experiment, students observe a natural process that removes carbon dioxide (CO2) from Earth's atmosphere. This process is a part of the carbon cycle and results in temperature suitable for life. Students learn that the carbon cycle is a fundamental Earth process. Throughout Earth's history, the balance of carbon has kept the atmosphere's carbon dioxide (CO2) and Earth's temperature within relatively narrow ranges.",Technology,Environmental Studies,"History, Law, Politics",Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
