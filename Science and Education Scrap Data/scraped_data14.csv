https://oercommons.org/courses/earthnow-climate-digest-2?__hub_id=100,"This visualization provides an informative summary of the quarterly seasonal global weather and climate using the 3-D Science on a Sphere format. These video summaries use animations of recent NOAA data and an engaging commentary to review the climate highlights of the past 4 seasons. Topics include, El Nino/La Nina, temperature trends, extreme weather, and emerging climate research.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/earth-system-ice-and-global-warming-2?__hub_id=100,"In this video, students learn that scientific evidence strongly suggests that different regions on Earth do not respond equally to increased temperatures. Ice-covered regions appear to be particularly sensitive to even small changes in global temperature. This video segment adapted from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center details how global warming may already be responsible for a significant reduction in glacial ice, which may in turn have significant consequences for the planet.",Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/earth-as-a-system-2?__hub_id=100,"This short video uses animated imagery from satellite remote sensing systems to illustrate that Earth is a complex, evolving body characterized by ceaseless change. Adapted from NASA, this visualization helps explain why understanding Earth as an integrated system of components and processes is essential to science education.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/efficiency-the-most-important-thing?__hub_id=100,This video addresses the importance of efficiency in providing power to an increasingly large global population.,Physical Science,Geoscience
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-101-wind-turbines-4?__hub_id=100,This video provides a simple introduction to wind turbines and how they generate electricity.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-card-game?__hub_id=100,"In this card game, participants trace back the source of energy for a variety of items to find that they ultimately derive from the Sun. This is a simple activity that lets students move around and discover an aspect of their everyday lives that may not have been apparent to them already.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-choices-and-climate-change?__hub_id=100,"This interactive provides two scenarios for students to look at issues related to energy and climate change: from the perspective of either a family, or a monarch.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-consumption-rates-across-the-usa-and-the-world?__hub_id=100,Students use Google Earth to analyze oil consumption per capita in the US and around the world. Students then use spreadsheets to create graphs and calculate statistics regarding per capita energy use among various categories.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Political Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-enigma?__hub_id=100,"This activity is a learning game in which student teams are each assigned a different energy source. Working cooperatively, students use their reading, brainstorming, and organizational skills to hide the identity of their team's energy source while trying to guess which energy sources the other teams represent.",Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-forms-and-changes?__hub_id=100,"This pair of interactive visualizations allows students to explore basic and more complex concepts around heat conduction, heat capacity and energy transfer. The basic simulation demonstrates how heating and cooling iron, brick, water, and olive oil adds or removes energy from a system and transfers between objects. At the more advanced level, the systems simulation allows students to see that energy takes various forms, as well as how energy flows and changes from one form of energy into another.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-energy-game-finding-energy-resources?__hub_id=100,"This energy game activity engages students in learning about energy sources. This game demonstrates that energy, the environment, and economics are closely tied together. During the course of the game and in the discussion afterward, students learn the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, net energy profit, law of diminishing returns, and that availability does not mean usefulness.",Technology,"History, Law, Politics",Physical Science,Geoscience,Space Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-production-by-country?__hub_id=100,This data visualization describes global and regional energy production. A pie chart shows percentage of each energy source used in various different countries.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-sources?__hub_id=100,This short video surveys the different current and potential sources of energy - both non-renewable and renewable. It provides some discussion of the pros and cons of the different sources and explains how they are used to produce energy that people can use.,Technology,Physical Science,Geoscience
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-sources-and-uses-flow-charts-2?__hub_id=100,This visualization includes a series of flow charts showing the relative size of primary energy resources and end uses in the United States for the years 2008-2012.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Physics
https://oercommons.org/courses/energy-flows?__hub_id=100,"This activity introduces students to different forms of energy, energy transformations, energy storage, and the flow of energy through systems. Students learn that most energy can be traced back to nuclear fusion on the sun.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Physics
