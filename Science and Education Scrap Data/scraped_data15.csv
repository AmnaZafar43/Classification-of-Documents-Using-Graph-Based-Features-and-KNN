https://oercommons.org/courses/envisioning-climate-change-using-a-global-climate-model?__hub_id=100,"This long classroom activity introduces students to a climate modeling software. Students visualize how temperature and snow coverage might change over the next 100 years. They run a 'climate simulation' to establish a baseline for comparison, do a 'experimental' simulation and compare the results. Students will then choose a region of their own interest to explore and compare the results with those documented in the IPCC impact reports. Students will gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the process and power of climate modeling.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science

https://oercommons.org/courses/evaluating-the-effects-of-local-energy-resource-development?__hub_id=100,"This is a semester-long jigsaw project in which students work in teams to explore the effects of energy resource development on local water resources, economics, and society. Students are presented with a contemporary energy resource development issue being debated in their community. They research the water, geological, economic, and social impact of the project, and then either defend or support the development proposal.",Environmental Studies,Physical Science

https://oercommons.org/courses/evidence-of-ice-free-seas?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students make a model sea floor sediment core using two types of buttons to represent fossil diatoms. They then compare the numbers of diatom fossils in the sediment at different depths to determine whether the seas were free of ice while the diatoms were alive.",Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/expecting-the-unexpected-abrupt-climate-change-2?__hub_id=100,"In this video scientists discuss possible rates of sea level rise, storms and resulting damage, rising temperatures and melting ice, and their collective effects on ecosystems.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/exploring-green-jobs?__hub_id=100,"In this lesson, students complete a Myers-Briggs Type Inventory of their personality type as an introductory step to understanding what green jobs might suit their personal styles. From the information on this online tool, they look at different green jobs to explore possible careers.",Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/exploring-regional-differences-in-climate-change?__hub_id=100,"This teaching activity addresses regional variability as predicted in climate change models for the next century. Using real climatological data from climate models, students will obtain annual predictions for minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation for Minnesota and California to explore this regional variability. Students import the data into a spreadsheet application and analyze it to interpret regional differences. Finally, students download data for their state and compare them with other states to answer a series of questions about regional differences in climate change.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
