https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-travels-then-and-now?__hub_id=100,Students play the role of carbon atoms to learn about the carbon cycle and how it is changing. Students create two carbon cycle diagramsâvisual models of the cycle before and after the Industrial Revolution. They reflect on the game and how scientists believe humans are impacting this critical Earth system.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbonated-communities?__hub_id=100,"This series of two lessons uses cutting-edge scientific research on the effects of climate change on communities in the intertidal. Through a combination of a dynamic presentation and several videos, students are introduced to the effects of climate change on the ocean (ocean acidification and temperature increase) and what is known about how ocean organisms are affected. Then students read and interpret graphs and construct a scientific explanation based on data from this research.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Ecology,Physical Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/carbon-on-the-move-3?__hub_id=100,"In this 3-part lab activity, students investigate how carbon moves through the global carbon cycle and study the effects of specific feedback loops on the carbon cycle.",Environmental Studies,Biology,Physical Science,Chemistry,Geology
https://oercommons.org/courses/car-of-the-future?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, student teams research and develop a proposal to decrease the carbon footprint of their city's/town's public transportation system and then prepare a report that explains why their transportation plan is the best for their community.",Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/catching-a-heat-wave?__hub_id=100,"Students model the effect of greenhouse gases on Earth's atmosphere. They find that greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are uniquely shaped to catch and pass on infrared radiation, and so they are responsible for the warmth we enjoy on Earth. The children discuss how the addition of greenhouse gases by human activities leads to further warming and what steps we can take to slow it.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/catch-the-world-s-oceans?__hub_id=100,Children get to know each other through an icebreaker activity that introduces the importance of water on Earth.,Environmental Studies,Physical Science,Oceanography
https://oercommons.org/courses/ch-ch-ch-changes?__hub_id=100,"This activity engages learners in exploring the impact of climate change on arctic sea ice in the Bering Sea. They graph and analyze sea ice extent data, conduct a lab on thermal expansion of water, and then observe how a scientist collects long-term data on a bird population.",Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Biology,Ecology,Physical Science,Oceanography

https://oercommons.org/courses/changes-in-hardiness-zones-3?__hub_id=100,"This animation illustrates how the hardiness zones for plants have changed between 1990 and 2006 based data from 5,000 National Climatic Data Center cooperative stations across the continental United States.",Environmental Science,Agriculture,Environmental Studies,Biology,Ecology,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/changes-in-our-local-environment?__hub_id=100,"In this activity, students research changes to the environment in the Arctic/Bering Sea over time using oral and photographic histories. Developed for Alaska Native students, this activity can be customized for other regions.",Environmental Science

https://oercommons.org/courses/changing-climate-changing-habitats?__hub_id=100,"This video looks at the impact of changing climate on animal habitats around the world, showing how different creatures are responding to changing temperatures and precipitation patterns.",Atmospheric Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/the-changing-geographic-distribution-of-malaria-with-global-climate-warming-2?__hub_id=100,This activity engages students in the analysis of climate data to first find areas in the southern United States that are now close to having conditions in which the malaria parasite and its mosquito hosts thrive and then attempt to forecast when areas might become climatically suitable.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/changing-planet-adaptation-of-butterflies-2?__hub_id=100,This video addresses the impact of climate change on several butterfly populations. Warming temperatures lead to shifts in location of populations of butterflies or die-offs of populations unable to adapt to changing conditions or shift to new locations.,Environmental Science,Environmental Studies,Biology,Ecology,Physical Science
https://oercommons.org/courses/changing-planet-fading-corals-3?__hub_id=100,"This video provides a comprehensive introduction to the role of coral reefs, the physiology of corals, and the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on coral survival.
