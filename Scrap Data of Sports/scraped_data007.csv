Universities, coaches, the NCAA, and television companies make millions and even billions of dollars a year off the entertainment provided by student athletes. This seminar will examine the controversy surrounding the issue of whether student athletes should be receiving a monetary stipend beyond scholarships.

In this spirit, students follow the steps of engineering design process as they design, build and test protective padding for an egg drop. Many of the design considerations surrounding egg drops are similar to sports equipment design. Watching the transformation of energy from potential to kinetic, observing the impact and working under material constraints introduces students to ""sports engineering"" and gives them a chance to experience some of the challenges engineers face in designing equipment to protect athletes.",Architecture and Design,Engineering

The goal is for students to understand the basics of engineering associated with the design of athletic shoes. The design of footware based on how it will be used involves bioengineering. Students analyze the foot movements in a variety of sports, develop design criteria for a specific sport, and make recommendations for requirements for the sneakers used in that sport.",Architecture and Design,Engineering
