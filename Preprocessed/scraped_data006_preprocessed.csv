"Roman version of a Greek bronze original of about 440430 BC, found at Vaison, France. Known as the Daidoumenos (ribbon wearer) this statue shows a triumphant athlete tying a ribbon round his head immediately after a victory.  Winners in the ancient Olympics were allowed to set up statues of themselves at Olympia. If they won three times they could set up specially commissioned portrait statues which could cost up to ten times the average yearly wage. © Trustees of the British Museum",sports
"This is a PBL activity/lesson plan for sixth grade students. It focuses on forming opinions backed with well-researched information to back it up, as well as encouraging debate and speaking skills as the students participate in a classroom discussion (Socratic seminar) and defend their opinions against an opposing party. They learn to defend themselves and refute the other side's arguments in a respectful manner.",sports
"This resource is a video abstract of a research paper created by Research Square on behalf of its authors. It provides a synopsis that's easy to understand, and can be used to introduce the topics it covers to students, researchers, and the general public. The video's transcript is also provided in full, with a portion provided below for preview:""Shoulder dislocations and partial dislocations are some of the most common and disabling injuries in active young people, especially athletes. After the bone has been popped back and the initial agony is over, the issue of what to do next is much debated. One option is surgery to try to repair the damage, but whether that is preferable to less-invasive care remains controversial. Researchers now have evidence that supports the surgical option, at least for young people suffering a first event. The team monitored the degree of bone damage to the shoulder socket, or glenoid bone, which holds the head of the humerus in place. Until now, there has not been much information about the extent of this damage to guide a decision on the best approach. The shoulders of 714 student athletes were imaged by MRI scanning, and the subjects were then followed for four years...""

The upcoming 2020 Olympics in Japan will be the first to feature climbing as one of its prestigious events. While research has helped climbers learn how to avoid injuries to their upper body, surprisingly little is known about the effects of climbing on the lower body. Now, for the first time, researchers have discovered patterns of knee injury across both competitive and noncompetitive climbers. Their findings, published in the March issue of The American Journal of Sports Medicine, could offer athletes and healthcare providers useful tips on how to avoid or bounce back from injury. Over a period of 4 years, the authors of the study looked at 71 patients with 77 independent acute knee injuries due to climbing. Athletes were grouped by performance level, either competitive or noncompetitive, and injuries were classified by climbing type, due either to rope climbing or to bouldering, both indoor and outdoor...""

"In this lesson, students learn about psychological variables that can affect athletic performance. Students will also be able to identify strategies to help athletes cope with stresses. The knowledge acquired will be incorporated within a player injury profile. This lesson 3 of 4 is a part of a injury management project.In this lesson students learn the basic terminology related to sports psychology and psychological variables that can affect athletic performance. Students will be able to understand coping strategies to help athletes deal with sport related stresses. The activities used to aid in understanding of sports psychology will be a lecture and video and article response writing along with  group discussion to athletes dealing with psychological barriers and how they cope with them.",sports

While the elements linked to surgical success in adult populations are well defined, they arent so clear for younger patients. New research from the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York suggests that for these patients, age matters when it comes to protecting the knee. That conclusion stems from an evaluation of 324 athletes under 20 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction following a sports injury. A key consideration when operating on this group is minimizing the risk of growth disturbances. Children and young adolescents havent reached skeletal maturity, which has led to the development of age-specific surgical techniques. Researchers compared several of these approaches among groups divided based on skeletal age, school age distribution, surgical technique, and graft selection. Clinical follow-up was performed for at least 2 years..."" The rest of the transcript, along with a link to the research itself, is available on the resource itself.",sports
