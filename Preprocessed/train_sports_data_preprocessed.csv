"A project developed by Cornell Colleges KIN-200, Athletes and Activism class.  Authored by Caitlin Babcock, Alec Boldt, Cristian Dixon, Megan Gandrup, Olivia Henkel, MacKenzie Macam, Caitlyne Mar, Kali March, Alexis Partida, Ilah Perez-Johnson, Mary Puffett, Kara Rivard, Julissa Rivera, and Delaney Thomas; edited by Professor Christi Johnson. Because of the power that sports have to shape our understandings of everyday life, we explore the stories of athletes who became activists related to social justice causes.  These athletes used their platforms to advocate for positive social change.  We summarize and share their stories here.  In addition to describing their athletic pursuits, our summaries of their stories include key terms, concepts, and definitions related to socially just causes.  We also include short video overviews of the athletes' sporting lives and social activism.",sports

"In this lesson, students will have the opportunity to learn about one such game, which is often called double ball in English. Double ball is a team sport that is similar to the contemporary game of lacrosse, in that it involves multiple players using long sticks and a ball, with the purposein most versionsof getting the ball across a goal line or through some sort of target. Many tribes, including several in Oregon, played a version of double ball and continue to do so today.While focused on physical education, this lesson reinforces two important concepts that are woven throughout this curriculum. First, students will learn that while there are many similarities across tribal nations and Indigenous communities including some of the games they playNative American people are far from homogeneous and in fact represent a rich diversity of unique cultures. Second, students will be encouraged to think about how the specific natural environment in which a given tribe livedits ancestral territory shaped its identity and culture in both large and small ways. Understanding this strong connection to place is essential to understanding and respecting Native American cultures in Oregon and across North America, past and present.",sports

After the bone has been popped back and the initial agony is over, the issue of what to do next is much debated. One option is surgery to try to repair the damage, but whether that is preferable to less-invasive care remains controversial. Researchers now have evidence that supports the surgical option, at least for young people suffering a first event. The team monitored the degree of bone damage to the shoulder socket, or glenoid bone, which holds the head of the humerus in place. Until now, there has not been much information about the extent of this damage to guide a decision on the best approach. The shoulders of 714 student athletes were imaged by MRI scanning, and the subjects were then followed for four years...""

The upcoming 2020 Olympics in Japan will be the first to feature climbing as one of its prestigious events. While research has helped climbers learn how to avoid injuries to their upper body, surprisingly little is known about the effects of climbing on the lower body. Now, for the first time, researchers have discovered patterns of knee injury across both competitive and noncompetitive climbers. Their findings, published in the March issue of The American Journal of Sports Medicine, could offer athletes and healthcare providers useful tips on how to avoid or bounce back from injury. Over a period of 4 years, the authors of the study looked at 71 patients with 77 independent acute knee injuries due to climbing. Athletes were grouped by performance level, either competitive or noncompetitive, and injuries were classified by climbing type, due either to rope climbing or to bouldering, both indoor and outdoor...""

While the elements linked to surgical success in adult populations are well defined, they arent so clear for younger patients. New research from the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York suggests that for these patients, age matters when it comes to protecting the knee. That conclusion stems from an evaluation of 324 athletes under 20 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction following a sports injury. A key consideration when operating on this group is minimizing the risk of growth disturbances. Children and young adolescents havent reached skeletal maturity, which has led to the development of age-specific surgical techniques. Researchers compared several of these approaches among groups divided based on skeletal age, school age distribution, surgical technique, and graft selection. Clinical follow-up was performed for at least 2 years..."" The rest of the transcript, along with a link to the research itself, is available on the resource itself.",sports
