"Ultimate Frisbee is simple and straightforward: a field, two teams and one disc. While it takes very little to start, it yields a lot in return by encouraging healthy bodies, lifestyles and mentalities. Ultimate Frisbee teaches responsibility and fair-play by putting officiating, game management and team conduct largely in the hands of its players. Ultimate Frisbee promotes a culture of valuing all of its members and being inclusive by gender, race/ethnicity and levels of mental and physical ability. It builds cohesion among diverse players and forms a community. Its a safe, non-contact sport where girls and boys may play together even at the highest levels.",sports

"This trick from Exploratorium physicist Paul Doherty lets you add together the bounces of two balls and send one ball flying. When we tried this trick on the Exploratorium's exhibit floor, we gathered a crowd of visitors who wanted to know what we were doing. We explained that we were engaged in serious scientific experimentation related to energy transfer. Some of them may have believed us. If you'd like to go into the physical calculations of this phenomenam, see the related resource ""Bouncing Balls"" - it's the same activity but with the math explained.",sports
"In this lesson, students will have the opportunity to learn about one such game, which is often called double ball in English. Double ball is a team sport that is similar to the contemporary game of lacrosse, in that it involves multiple players using long sticks and a ball, with the purposein most versionsof getting the ball across a goal line or through some sort of target. Many tribes, including several in Oregon, played a version of double ball and continue to do so today.While focused on physical education, this lesson reinforces two important concepts that are woven throughout this curriculum. First, students will learn that while there are many similarities across tribal nations and Indigenous communities including some of the games they playNative American people are far from homogeneous and in fact represent a rich diversity of unique cultures. Second, students will be encouraged to think about how the specific natural environment in which a given tribe livedits ancestral territory shaped its identity and culture in both large and small ways. Understanding this strong connection to place is essential to understanding and respecting Native American cultures in Oregon and across North America, past and present.",sports
